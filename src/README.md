# Conclusions

This attempt was better for some things and worst for others ones. One of the main errors here was treating the input as a number instead of text. It can look like it was not that bad, but it blocked me for some minutes.

The good thing in this one was creating an object with the different elements for the operations. This is an excellent way to manage the calculator's state.
