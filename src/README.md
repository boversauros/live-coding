# Calculator LiveCoding

Program a calculator. Your website should have buttons from 0 to 9 and Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations. Also, the equals (=) button to calculate the result and to display at all times what the user is writing and the result of the procedure.

**Challenge time "45" minutes**

## Things to improve

- The first thing that I will do is fix bugs. Right now, the calculator only can add one integer. This is a crucial thing to fix as the functionality is not complete.
- I will add a proper button to reset the operations. The _C_ button. I will create a _reset_ function and set default values.
- **Style** is important. I will give a better UI
- Support for float numbers. Now it only works with integers.
- Adding keyboard support.
