# Thougts

**Challenge time 1 hour**

This has been a tricky one. It has been difficult for me to organize all my ideas at once. The steps that I followed are

1. Create a mocks folder to work with them
2. Define all the UI and style it
3. Start breaking it into UI components
4. Create Single page
5. Replace the mocks for actual fetching
6. Create Components/page/logic.. folder

There are better ways to work than this, and I can find more exciting ways to do it cleverly.
