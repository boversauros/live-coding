# Conclusions

This attempt has been much better. I could finalize all the requirements from the challenge and present a cleaner input.

What unblocked me this time was spending less time styling the web. Memorizing table styles has been a win-win situation for me.

## Next steps

There is a lot of repetition using the fetch. Having everything in the principal file is not optimal. My next step is to encapsulate the business logic and to quit them from this file.

Creating a custom hook for fetching will help me reuse logic across the application.

Giving general context using `useContext` or a Data Layer library like [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) can be a good idea.
