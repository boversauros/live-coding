## Description

This repository, `live-coding`, is a storage for different live coding exercises.

## Structure

This repository has a unique structure. The `main` branch will always be kept clean (empty) and all content will be saved under separate branches, each one representing a different live coding exercise or a set of exercises.

## How to Navigate

To navigate through the repository, simply change branches. Each branch represents a different live coding exercise. You can easily change branches using the following command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

You can view all branches by using:

```bash
git branch -a
```

## Conventions

The naming of the branches will follow a consistent pattern for easy understanding:

```bash
<topic>/<exercise-name>
```

For example, for a web development exercise on React Hooks, the branch would be named `web-development/react-hooks`.
